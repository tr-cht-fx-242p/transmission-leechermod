This release validates all known bugs have been eliminated.

NONE of the 2.8x branch's current unsolved or past bugs have
ever been introduced to this release. All 2.8x features and
enhancements are included in this release (except rename).

This release includes updates to the DHT and fixes an insignificant
memory leak after adding a corrupt torrent.
(Yet to be fixed in the official 2.8x branch).

A multitude of new bugs were introduced with the official 2.8x branch's
quark and threading model changes. The official 2.8x branch's quark and
threading model changes introduced and continue to allow for a multitude
of unsolved past and yet undiscovered new bugs and crashes.
